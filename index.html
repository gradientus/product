        <h2 id="title">Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner</h2>
        <p id="gruner-description1">
          Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner is a white wine, made almost exclusively in
          Austria. It is an excellent alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot
          Blanc.
        </p>
        <p id="gruner-description2">
          The most prominent fruits in Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner are bell peppers
          and limes. For some of the more mature vintages, the flavor of
          nectarines and peaches can also come through. Other flavors can
          include tarragon, ginger, any honey. The best Gr&uuml;ner Veltliners
          will have a tingly aftertaste.

            <h4>2009 Vintage</h4>

            <p>
              The weather in early 2009 was wet and cold, with budbreak setting
              in at a late stage. May brought fog and light rains and cooler
              temperatures that slowed the vines and brought massive growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flowering progressed slowly in June, and into July, followed by a
              summer with mild temperatures and windy periods.
            </p>

            <p>
              Autumn weather was warmer than usual and we harvested the grapes
              in October. The grapes showed high sugar levels. 2009 is a
              gorgeous vintage and wine has given rise to profound celery,
              herbal, and peach jam aromas.

              May brought regular rain and light intense foggy periods.

              extremely hot temperatures.

            <h4>2019 Vintage</h4>
            <p>
              The weather in early 2019 was dry and mild, with budbreak setting
              in at an early stage. May brought heavy rains and cooler
              temperatures that slowed the vines and brought growth.
            </p>

              Flowering progressed quickly in June, followed by a summer with
              hot temperatures and extremely dry periods.
            </p>

            <p>
              Autumn weather was cooler than usual and we harvested the grapes
              in mid-September. The grapes showed only moderate sugar levels.
              2019 has the potential of becoming one of the most elegant and
              subtle vintages seen in years. The wine has given rise to profound
              aromas especially minerality and apricot.
